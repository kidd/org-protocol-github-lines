   At some point it got support for bitbucket repos also but it hasn't
   been updated in a while. PRs welcome.

   If you're using conkeror, you can `m-x clone-repo` to clone (both bb or gh)

** Code
*** Firefox/Chrome
   Install [[browser/edit-with-emacs.js]] using tampermonkey or whatever
   monkey are you using in your browser.

*** Conkeror
    In browser/org-protocol-github-lines.user.js theres the plugin
    that will insert the links on code comments that will link to
    emacs.

*** OS
    os/xdg-open Predefine org-protocol to open emacsclient

*** Emacs
    org-protocol-github-lines.el contains the code to open the actual file


** Conkeror
	 The js file for conkeror provides a command `m-x clone-repo` which
	 sends the signal to the emacs server to clone the
	 "repo-at-buffer". It works with both github and bitbucket.
